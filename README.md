# Beender

## Introduction

Beender is an application designed to help users plan their next trip from start to finish. The application works similarly to "Tinder" in that it presents cards of sites, selected according to the user’s preferences, and the user can swipe right if he wants to visit that site, or swipe left if he doesn't. The sites are drawn using Google API. Additionally, when the user presses a card, another screen appears with more information about that site such as additional photos, ratings, and reviews. Once the user has selected sites for their trip, they can go to the map screen and see all the sites they have chosen and a recommended route. The user can see all his past trips in the archive screen.

<div style="overflow: auto;">
  <img src="pics/Picture3.png" style="width:25%; float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
  <div style="float:right; margin-left:20px;">
    On this screen you can set your preferences how you like.
    Make sure to choose between a “Journey” or “Star” type trip, as it changes how you plan your trip.
    
    Journey: A journey trip is a simple A -> B type of a route. You select an initial destination, and go through waypoints until you end in your last destination. This type of a trip is suited for users that plan to be on the move and visit many different places throughout the trip.
    
    Star: A star trip starts at a hotel, and branches out to different routes that are separated by days. Each day you’ll visit a few destinations and return to the hotel to end the day. This type of a trip is suited for users who plan to stay around the same area and get to experience a specific place, like a city.
    
    For a star type trip, you need to input the length of your trip in days in the preferences screen.
